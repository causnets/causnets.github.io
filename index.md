Over the past decade, the fields of **network science** and **causal inference** have each made significant statistical and algorithmic advances. Understanding node-to-node connections and cause-and-effect relationships are each seen as fundamental to studying complex natural and social systems. There is a natural synergy between these two perspectives: connections between nodes can act as conduits of causal influence, while external causal interventions can selectively precipitate node-level connections.

The inaugural CausNetS satellite at NetSci 2026 aims to bring these two fields closer together, with an overall aim of moving toward a causal network science. It will be held on **June 1, 2026 in Boston, MA, USA** as part of NetSci 2026, and attendees must therefore register [here](https://www.netsci2026.com/registration). This half-day satellite will feature a mix of invited and contributed talks 

## Call for Abstracts

As part of the program we invite abstract submissions that are due by **11:59 PM [AOE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe) on March (TBD), 2026**; see further details [below](#extended-abstract-details). We welcome submissions on a variety of topics at the intersection of causal inference and network science, including but not limited to:
* network interference or SUTVA violations
* causal interventions on network structure
* real-world (offline/online) networked interventions
* causal mechanisms of network spillovers
* stochastic modeling for interference
* causal inference under network misspecification
* transportability of causal network effects
* designs for measuring spillover effects
* optimal policy choice under interference
We note that there will be no proceedings published as part of this satellite and invite new, previously published, or ongoing work for submission. We especially encourage graduate students and early career researchers to submit.

## Extended Abstract Details

Please submit an extended abstract **of no longer than 2 pages** -- including references, and any figures -- and submit as a .pdf via this [Google form]().
