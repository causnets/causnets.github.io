Over the past decade, the fields of network science and causal inference have each made significant statistical and algorithmic advances. Understanding node-to-node connections and cause-and-effect relationships are each seen as fundamental to studying complex natural and social systems. There is a natural synergy between these two perspectives: connections between nodes can act as conduits of causal influence, while external interventions can selectively precipitate node-level connections. This conference satellite aims to bring these two fields closer together, with an overall aim of moving toward a causal network science.
